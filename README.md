# 1-dimensional cell cycle analysis

Use data from single-cell immunofluoerscence imaging such as cells stained with DAPI, HOECHST, PI, and assess cell cycle stage based on the histogram. Available is a *manaual mode* where user can identify G1 and G2/M peaks and their width manually, or *fitting mode* where a simple G1G2S0 model can be fit to the histogram.

The app uses R/Shiny framework.
